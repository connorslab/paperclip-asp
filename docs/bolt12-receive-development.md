# Reusable BOLT12 receive development

Status: incomplete; not enabled in the published wallet or server packages.

The target is a reusable BOLT12 offer. A single-use invoice is not a substitute.
Every payment must use a fresh wallet-owned preimage and settle through the Ark
HTLC claim process. The server must not collect a normal CLN offer payment and
credit a custodial balance in its place.

## Implemented on the development branch

- Receive checkpoints and permanent settlement records accept BOLT11 and BOLT12
  invoices. Existing invoice strings and BOLT11 checkpoint JSON remain readable.
- Receive status and cancellation can identify a payment by either invoice format.
- Server subscription records accept both formats. Exact invoice matching remains
  required for internal payments; an identical hash alone is not sufficient.
- Wallet receive cards generate QR codes locally. Copy, native sharing where
  available, SVG download, mobile layout and reduced motion are supported.

The candidate adds `/api/v1/lightning/offers` (GET, POST, DELETE), a wallet-owned
signing key, a persistent reusable offer, authenticated live request sessions,
and per-request hold registration. Reusable receiving requires the new server
capability; existing wallets can continue using the ASP's unchanged BOLT11 APIs.
`experimental_bolt12_receive` defaults to false. Public releases remain disabled
until the end-to-end checks below pass.

The wallet daemon must be online to answer new invoice requests. Closing the
browser does not stop it. Manual-sync mode cannot create offers. Disabling an
offer stops new requests but preserves issued invoices and their claim records.
A replay of the same signed request uses the same stored invoice; a distinct
request derives a distinct preimage. The ASP never receives the signing key or
the preimage before the ordinary recoverable Ark HTLC claim.

The offer checkpoint is a new persisted record type. Keep a complete wallet
backup and do not downgrade an active candidate wallet to an older binary that
cannot read this checkpoint.

## Release verification checklist

1. Persist authenticated offer registration, revocation and per-payment request
   bindings. Bound requests and stored records to prevent resource exhaustion.
2. Route BOLT12 invoice requests through the hold plugin onion-message stream.
   Validate signed requests, offer ownership, XBT identity, network, amount and
   expiry before allocating a payment hash. Preserve unrelated CLN offer traffic.
3. Persist wallet-owned secrets before making invoices payable. Allocate a fresh
   secret per payment; never reuse a settled, expired or canceled payment hash.
4. Build and sign matching BOLT12 invoices and register hold state plus the Ark
   subscription before returning an invoice. The wallet must verify that each
   invoice matches its hash, offer, amount, XBT identity and required CLTV window.
5. Resume requests, hold reconciliation and Ark claims after wallet/server restart.
   Cancellation must not lose a pending claim or disclose a secret before the
   wallet obtains recoverable HTLC VTXOs. Preserve settlement secrets for exits.
6. Add offer creation, copy/QR, status and disable controls with clear online and
   offline limits. Keep the reusable offer separate from its payment activity.
7. Test two payments to the same offer with different hashes, concurrent requests,
   duplicate/replayed requests, retries, expiry, revocation, depleted liquidity,
   restarts and recovery. Run a complete CLN-to-Ark settlement in isolated regtest.
8. Only after these checks, enable the server capability, build both image
   architectures, test Umbrel, sign StartOS 0.4 packages, update store pins and
   publish matching source/release documentation. Old clients must not receive
   a BOLT12 response in a field documented as BOLT11.

## Validation performed on the groundwork

The QR test supports an independent jsQR decoder supplied as its CLI argument.
Browser tests cover actual rendered scan round trips, mobile overflow, reduced
motion and clearing QR images on lock. Rust tests cover legacy checkpoint JSON,
BOLT12 checkpoint/settlement persistence, payment hash validation and exact
server invoice matching.

Isolated XBT regtest now passes real CLN-to-Ark payments to one reusable offer,
concurrent requests with distinct payment hashes, wallet and ASP restart with an
issued invoice, and disabling an offer without discarding issued invoices.
The exact published 0.7.7 wallet image was also tested against the candidate ASP:
on-chain boarding, BOLT11 receiving, and paying the reusable BOLT12 offer work
without upgrading the wallet.
Its image index digest is
`sha256:93eb4684ed19d6af16c1257854a5d169d9e1aeb766257697ff4b057f7118de97`.

Interoperability testing found and corrected an LDK-specific receive-path
authentication mismatch: the CLN relay path now uses standard BOLT4 empty-AAD
encryption. A recipient-side decryption/tampering test protects this behavior.
These checks are not an independent security audit. Failure/recovery coverage and
platform release acceptance remain gates before coordinated public rollout.

Failure tests also cover an offline recipient timing out without Ark credit,
refused unauthenticated cancellation preserving the wallet checkpoint, and
CLN-side cancellation clearing an unpaid receive. The ASP reconciles canceled
`Created` subscriptions through both event streaming and reconnect polling;
it preserves `Accepted`/`HtlcsReady` subscriptions, including intra-Ark payments.
